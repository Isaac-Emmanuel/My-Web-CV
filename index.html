                I am a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner, with two years of general practice in the cloud computing field. I am also an avid enthusiast for front-end development and website development with intermediate knowledge in the respective fields. In addition, I gained relevant graphic design skills in UI/UX (i.e, User Interface and User Experience) under the Zuri Academy I4G training program in 2020, during the COVID lockdown phase. 
I love learning about new technology, listening to music, going to live concerts and reading. I am currently training to become a certified Linux Professional this year also. I also love browsing through <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Hisaac01/" target="_blank">Twitter!</a> where I enjoy sharing inspiring contents, as well as gaining new knowledge from relevant communities on the application.
